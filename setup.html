You need to do this only once before you start using Friends and Family. The phrase you are to enter will have been given to you
by another member of the FF group. It is not case sensitive.<p>
Nothing will be sent over the wire, so this initial setting is quite safe. Keep the memorable phrase confidential to the group.<p>
This does not set your password. Your initial password will be given to you by the FF group member who sponsored/registered you.
You should change it as soon as you start using FF.<p>
Enter your memorable phrase:<br>
<input type="text" id="thephrase"><br>
<button type="button" id="go" onclick="processIt();">Process it</button>
